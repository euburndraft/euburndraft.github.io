Wildfires are becoming more intense and more frequent in Europe, ravaging people, properties and ecosystems in their path. They also release large amounts of gases and aerosols into the atmosphere, which can exacerbate air pollution and climate change. With global temperatures on the rise, the need to reduce wildfire risks is more critical than ever.

**EUBURN** is the first multi-year and multi-scale field campaign supported by a modelling framework on wildfires and their associated atmospheric emissions in the most fire-prone regions of Southern Europe. **EUBURN** will gather the data needed to advanceÂ the current state of the science and operational management, thus making a crucial step in improving: 
- the monitoring and forecasting of wildfire behavior and smoke plume
- knowledge of the present and future impacts of wildfire emissions on population, meteorology and climate
- the effectiveness of fire suppression efforts
- populations and ecosystems safety
- mitigation and adaptation strategies
      
**EUBURN** brings together research institutes, meteorological centres, civil security practitioners, industry partners and governmental authorities to share advances in science and technology transfer. Through international collaborative efforts and interdisciplinary approaches, **EUBURN** aims to facilitate the translation of scientific research into practical solutions and promote efficient science-based wildfire, air pollution and climate change managements.
