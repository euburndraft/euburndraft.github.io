## The new wildfire regime in Europe
Recent catastrophic events point to the emergence of a new wildfire regime in Europe. Climate change has increased the duration of the fire season, as well as the size, intensity and severity of wildfires. Projections suggest that wildfires occurrence will increase more rapidly in the southern Europe as compared with the global average. The need to reduce wildfire risks is more critical than ever.

## Protecting populations, nature and assets against wildfire spread
Understanding where and how fast the wildfire moves are essential for protecting people lives, ecosystems and properties. The unpredictable nature of wildfires underscores a crucial issue: without near real-time monitoring and modelling tools, effective responses to safeguard are difficult. Considerable gaps remain on how fuel, weather, soil moisture, topography and spatial scales interact and influence fire ignition, spread and intensity. Advanced detection, monitoring and prediction of wildfire behaviour in different ecosystems are urgently needed for supporting fire fighters to allocate resources effectively and mitigating adverse impacts of wildfires on communities, properties and natural habitats. 


## Supporting decision making process concerning the population and ecosystems’ exposure to wildfire-induced pollution

Wildfires are a massive, highly variable, and uncontrollable source of gases and aerosols for the atmosphere. Compared to the direct exposure to the flames and heat of wildfires, exposure to smoke affects much larger populations and carries much greater risks to public health. Wildfire aerosol deposition also induces downwind ecological impacts through physical, chemical, and biological effects on plants, birds and water quality. Although air quality regulations have reduced aerosol concentrations in Europe, these reductions could be partly offset in the future by emissions from increased wildfires. The projections of more severe and more frequent events due to climate change increases the need for monitoring and preventing wildfire-induced pollution in support to political decision making process to ensure a better protection of humans and ecosystems’ health.


## Mitigating climate change and adapting to its effects

A major objective of the global atmospheric research community is to significantly reduce the uncertainties of current state-of-the-art climate projections. Aerosols emitted by wildfires are dominated by carbonaceous particles, composed of black carbon (BC) and organic aerosol (OA), the latter including brown carbon (BrC). While all particle species scatter light – inducing a net atmospheric cooling effect – BC and BrC strongly absorb incoming solar radiation, which can amplify global warming, modify precipitation regime and increase the risk of wildfires. Advancements in fundamental understanding of key climate-relevant properties of smoke and their implementation in climate models are urgently needed to assess European and International strategies aiming at both mitigating climate change and adapting to future wildfire risks.
