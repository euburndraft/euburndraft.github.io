EUBURN aims to improve knowledge of the present and future impacts of wildfires occurring in the southern Europe,  to develop risk prevention tools for populations, fire fighters and public authorities on their associated direct (fire behaviour) and indirect (air quality, climate change) impacts, and to leverage high-resolution satellite data to monitor wildfires and smoke plumes. Its aim is to strengthen wildfires and smokes observation and modelling through an innovative global approach by coupling processes at different interfaces (landscape, biodiversity, fire, atmosphere) and at different scales (local to regional). It will rely on innovative multi-year and multi-scale field campaigns to gain new insights, methods and practices for protecting people, nature and assets against wildfire risks.


## Wildfire behaviour 

When it comes to fighting wildfires, technology has very clear limitations. This is because controlling wildfire behavior is highly dependent on the vegetation type, fuel moisture, topography and meteorological conditions.  EUBURN proposes an innovative observation framework to provide new insights at unprecedented level of detail into the processes that drives wildfire ignition, spread and intensity :
- Land-scale flammability
- Fire propagation in fuel beds
- Firebrands and spotting ignition 
- Critical weather factors influencing fire behavior 
      
This will enable to develop different tools to support advances in fire research, management, and policy making: 
- Monitoring wildfire behaviour from new generation of satellites
- Near real-time physics-based wildfire behavior model.


## Emissions from wildfires
The emissions in the atmosphere from wildfires are one of the fundamental needs for predicting and assessing the impacts of wildfire-induced pollution on population, ecosystems and climate change. A wide variety of factors at the interface between the surface and the atmosphere influence these emissions, which remain a challenge to understand and thus to represent in models. EUBURN aims to obtain underprecedented observations on : 
- the amount of gases and aerosols emitted from European wildfires
- their chemical composition, toxicity and physical properties
- the smoke plume injection heights.

The resulting information will allow to refine and improve emission inventories used in meteorological, chemical-transport and climate models.

## Transport and transformation of plumes emitted by wildfires
Regardless of emissions, the gases and aerosols properties can vary greatly among plumes. There is a strong need to understand the physical and chemical transformations that occur when plumes emitted by wildfires are transported, diluted and exposed to different meteorological and chemical conditions. EUBURN aims to track the temporal evolution of gases and aerosols under various atmospheric conditions to improve the understanding of :
- the production and reduction of gases and aerosol during the plume transport
- the dynamic processes controlling the chemical, toxicity and physical evolution of aerosol mixing state 
- the influence of aerosol-induced solar heating in the smoke plume transport heights.

The novel dataset will allow to evaluate and improve meteorological, chemical-transport and climate models, as well as satellite retrieval methods, used in support to decision making process concerning the population and ecosystemsâ€™ exposure to wildfire-induced pollution on all time scales: from the immediate (fire management and health warnings), to the medium term (air quality exemptions) and up to the long term (management of ecosystems and the interface between urban and wooded areas). 

## Climate-relevant properties of biomass burning aerosol

Uncertainties in the representation of aerosol optical properties in climate and meteorological models contribute to a wide range in modelled effect of wildfire emissions on radiative budget. Depending on the climate model considered, this effect ranges from cooling to warming, which translates into conflicting estimates of aerosol-induced solar heating, cloud response and precipitation feedbacks. Measurements of optical properties of biomass burning aerosols on the entire shortwave spectrum from UV to near IR wavelengths will be available during EUBURN. These optical measurements will complete the physical and chemical observations in a unique and novel dataset for the area, which will make it possible to:
- develop an advanced process-based parametrization of aerosol optical properties for improved representation in climate and meteorological models
- evaluate and improve monitoring of smoke transport from new satellite generation. 
This will directly impact the assessment of different European and International strategies aiming at both mitigating and adapting climate change and and preventing future wildfire risks.
